                    Design and prepare to print (i.e. slice) either (a) a component you need for your final project or (b) a small object that could not be (easily) made by subtractive methods. Upload your 3D model file (e.g. .f3z), STL file, and sliced gcode file to your documentation.
                    Afterwards scan something using a photogrammetry application.

                <b>Modeling</b>
                <p>
                <br>
                    For the first portion of the assignment I chose to model a planter container to house a plant in.
                    I wanted the planter to have a screw at its center to make it look like a cool piece of decor for a room.
                    I sketched out the planter and included its basic dimensions to prepare to model it.

        <div class = "row">
            <div class = "col-lg">

            <div class="col-sm-8">
                <p>
                <br>
                    I then began the modeling process. I started with the main planter itself.
                    I created a sketch and drew up a circle matching the aforementioned dimensions in the sketch.
                    I then extruded the circle and used a hole modification tool to put a threaded hole into the side of the planter.
                    Afterwards I filleted the bottom edges of the planter to complete its look.

                <br>
                    With the main planter component finished I began on the screw. I created a sketch and drew a silhouette of the screw from the side.
                    I then used the revolve tool to rotate it one full revolution about the y-axis to form a solid. I selected the top face of the solid
                    and created another sketch on it before approximating the design from the aforementioned sketch. After completing the shape I extruded it into the screw by a
                    negative value. I filleted the edges of the indentation and the screw to soften its appearance. Lastly I used the solid thread tool to thread the surface of the solid to complete the look.

                    With both the main planter component and the screw component finished I could create an assembly to render.
                    I created a new file and dragged both components in and moved the screw until it fit into the screw hole I had burrowed into the planter.
                    After finishing the model I exported it as an .stl file and a .f3z file. Both files are available in the downloads section below.
                    I then imported the model into web slicer Kiri:Moto. I sliced the model and exported the gcode from the application. The gcode is also available in the downloads section below.

                    After exporting the necessary files (.stl, .f3z) from fusion360 and generating the gcode for the 3d printer
                    I switched to the render workflow and played around with different materials for the planter and the screw.
                    I ended up deciding on white silicon for the planter because it looked like ceramics and I used aluminum for the screw.
                    I was pretty happy with the final render. It looked a lot like what I had imagined when I drew up the sketch.

                    For the second portion of the assignment I downloaded the 3d scanner app off the appstore.
                    However, it turned out that my iphone did not have an onboard lidar scanner so instead I downloaded the capture app off the appstore.
                    This app used the truedepth features of the front facing camera rather than a lidar scanner, so it was harder to use.
                    I decided to scan a coffee cup, which turned out alright.
                    The scanner could only capture a couple of views of the mug at a time to generate a 3d model, but the textures looked really accurate and neat until they phased out.
