Consolidate your final project updates to a single "process" page. Optionally, create an additional concise "finished product" page. Plan on creating a 1-minute demo video for your final project.

                    For the first part of the assignment
                    I wanted to send accelerometer data from the microcontroller and visualize it in the unity3d engine.
                    I wanted to illustrate the orientation of the acceleromter with a cube, and I wanted to illustrate the values as changing text next to the cube.

                <br>
                    First I built the circuit using an esp32 microcontroller, an accelerometer, a breadboard and some male wires.
                    This was the same circuit I built for a previous assignment, but I think I might have used different digital pins that time.

                <br>
                    After building the circuit I wrote the firmware for the esp32 microcontroller.
                    All I had the microcontroller do was send averaged accelerometer data to my laptop via udp.
                    A lot of the code was boilerplate so I just reused most of the things I did for previous assignments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    *My bad, I got ride of the angle brackets surrounding each header file in the include preprocessor statements
                    because leaving them in made them disappear on the website.
                    If you have an adafruit lis3dh accelerometer and you change the spi pins
                    in the lis3dh object constructor parameter to the appropriate ones for your circuit then it should work fine.

                <br>
                    After I wrote the firmware I began to write the software for unity.
                    I wrote a class to get the data from the microcontroller over udp
                    and display it through text and the orientation of the cube.

                <br>
                    For the orientation part with the trig I used
                    <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMhbV1p3MWk">this</a>
                    youtube tutorial on converting acceleration magnitudes into orientation (roll and pitch).
                    The video was really helpful because it helped me understand how the trig for preparing and converting
                    the x, y and z magnitudes into an orientation worked.

                    These are the final results.
                    I was really happy with how the finished assignment looked.
                    The cube orientation was way more accurate than in the final project prototype assignment,
                    and looking at the values changing was cool as well.

                    The first image shows the unity window with the cube
                    (accelerometer orientation) to the left and the accelerometer
                    values to the right. The second image shows the controller connected and powered
                    on. Lastly the third image is a snapshot of the window as the program is running
                    and the accelerometer is connected and being moved around.
