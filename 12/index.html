            <b><br>Molding</b>
            <p>
            <br>
                For the first part of the assignment I chose to mold a lego.
                I wanted to create a lego mold so that I could cast a chocolate lego brick.
                To prepare for molding I found a ventilated area and put on vinyl gloves and my safety goggles.
                For the mold container I used one of the provided plastic cups in the kit molding and casting bag.
            </p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-8">
            <p>
            <br>
                With my materials and safety equipment ready I began to create the mold.
                Since the plastic cup I was using was already waterproof, I did not need to cover it with tape or anything so I used it as is.
                I taped the bottom of the lego brick to the bottom of the plastic food package with a piece
                of double sided tape.
            </p>

        <div class = "col-lg">

            <img src="img2.jpg" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:30%" alt="Sew">

        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-8">
            <p>
            <br>
                Afterwards I started preparing the silicon mixture.
                I slowly stirred both the solutions for about three minutes and was careful not to
                let any new air bubbles form.
                I then poured the white solution to about 25 CC in the provided cup, before pouring the purple solution to
                50 CC.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class = "col-lg">
            <br>

        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-8">
            <p>
            <br>
                I decided to use a lot less of the two solutions because I did not think that I would need a lot
                since I was only planning to mold a single lego brick in an already small container.
                I stirred the white and purple solution for another three minutes until white streaks
                were no longer visible and the solution looked uniform.
                After the mixture was complete I slowly poured it into the prepared container. I poured
                the mixture over a single area of the container and avoided drizzling it over the entirety of the
                surface so that I did not miss any air bubbles. Once the lego brick was submerged in the solution
                I quickly shook the container side to side to get rid of any final remaining air bubbles.
            </p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-8">
            <p>
            <br>
                The next day I observed the mold and found that the solution hardened.
            </p>

        <div class = "col-lg">

            <p>
            <br>
                I used an exacto knife and my fingers to carefully pry the solution from the container.
                The mold turned out great, and I could see that the details of the lego brick were clearly visible in
                the mold.

            <br>
                With the molding portion finished I began on the casting part.
                I found some chocolate and melted it in the microwave.
                I took the melted chocolate and slowly poured it into the lego mold.
                After I poured the melted chocolate in I tried scraping the excess off the mold and waited a couple
                of minutes for it to cool. It was taking way longer than I thought it would to cool so I ended up
                putting it in the freezer.
            </p>

        <div class = "col-lg">

            <br>
                After the chocolate cooled I removed it from the mold.
                I cut off the excess chocolate that stuck out from the lego shape.
                I was really happy with the final result. It looked exactly like a normal lego but
                made out of chocolate instead of plastic. I could probably use this lego mold in the future
                to create chocolate legos for pancakes.

            <br>
                After finishing the moldiong and casting portion of the assignment
                I included the documentation for my final project on the final project process page.
                I mainly worked on writing the controller firmware, implementing the brick class in unity to abstract
                controller connectivity and cleaning stuff up.
