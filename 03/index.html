                    Our third lesson covers electronics design using the Metro M0 Express microcontroller and various transducers provided in the kit.
                    We also cover the usage of the wire stripper and multimeter for constructing and testing circuitry.
                    Designing circuits that observe and interact with the real world is a fundamental part of digital fabrication.

                <b>Assignment</b>
                <p>
                <br>
                    Make a circuit on a breadboard with components in the kit. Use a multimeter to measure the voltages in your circuit. Use Ohm's law to calculate the current through some part of the circuit.
                    Simulate your circuit.
                    Use the Microcontroller Analog in (ADC) to measure the voltage of a potentiometer, or other voltage-divider-based sensor.
                    Document your work and learning.

                <b>Circuit Building</b>
                <p>
                <br>
                    I created a simple breadboard voltage divider circuit using two resistors.
                    After reviewing the readings on electricity and arduino building the circuit was straightforward.
                    I have never done hands on stuff with computers before so I had a lot of fun doing this and I was definitely ready to do the potentiometer segment.

                <b><br>Multimeter & Ohms Law</b>
                <p>
                <br>
                    I used the multimeter to measure the voltage preceding the first resistor and got a reading of 3.3 volts.
                    This made sense because the flow of charge leading up to the first resistor faced no prior resistance as it flowed from the 3.3 volt Metro M0 Express power supply.
                    Next I used the multimeter to measure the voltage succeeding the first resistor and got a reading of roughly 1.65 volts, roughly half of the previous measurement.
                    Lastly I measured the voltage following the second resistor and got 0 volts, once again halving the initial voltage.
                    After having measured the voltages I calculated the current of the circuit using Ohm's law.

                <br>
                    I then tried to recreate the circuit I built in real life in tinkercad so that I could simulate it.
                    I attached a multimeter to the simulated circuit and checked the voltages before and after each resistor and got the same measurements I did in reality.

                <b><br>Using the Potentiometer</b>
                <p>
                <br>
                    Finally I took out the wires and transducers in my breadboard to create another circuit using a potentiometer.
                    The potentiometer can be physically turned to adjust its resistance, dynamically altering the current running through the circuit.

                    I then used the analogRead (Microcontroller Analog In) function in an arduino sketch to print the voltage of the potentiometer to the arduino IDE console.
