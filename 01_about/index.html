                    Hello im <b> Sanchay Ravindiran </b> and I am a highschool student at Baltimore County Public Schools. I like drawing and reading. I want to learn to paint with watercolor. For my career I want to pursue either electrical engineering and computer science or something different relating to art. This website documents my undergraduate work in the <b> PHYS S-12 </b> introduction to digital fabrication course.

                    For my <b> final project </b> I want to make a simple controller with no buttons. I want to be able to control a character or an object on the screen with simple movements. For instance, maybe I could have a character perform a movement when the controller is shaken and perform another movement when the controller is moved from the left to the right. I would like the controller to be wireless and for it to connect to a desktop computer running the game when it is moved.
